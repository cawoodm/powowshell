#Thoughts

##IDE Technology
* HTML5: no OS; good look and JS; could add node.js server (or NW.js)
* HTA: poor JS/HTML; good option for a quick prototype
* jQuery UI: no have .HTA support (IE8)
* NW.js: Not a small/simple tool
* Node.js: Not a simple tool (client/server)
* Chrome Apps: issues with native messaging, chrome only
* C#: No HTML5, XAML? Difficult?
* Java: sucky suck
