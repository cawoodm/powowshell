PowerShell's Error Handling is genuinely weird and quirky

1. try...catch will not catch SOME exceptions
  * Like syntax errors
    * PowerShell will just stop processing and Write-Error the reason and line number
    * UNLES it's inside a try...catch block in which case it will just stop processing and Write-Error the reason and report the WRONG line number
  * Or non-terminating errors


If you don't `throw $_` inside a try...catch block you will get the wrong line number shown in the error above.
SO we should always throw from functions

Should we throw from Cmdlets?
